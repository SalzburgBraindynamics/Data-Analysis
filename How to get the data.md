# Access to data
When you have done a measurement in the MEG, the data is automatically synchronized to the university's storage. 
This happens at night, so you need to wait until the next morning.

You can get your data via a sftp connection to: meg-storage.ccns.sbg.ac.at.

Before you access it for the first time, write a mail to Hartmann Thomas and give him your university username (not your password!).
You can login with any sftp client you like. FileZilla is a free one that works well and runs on Windows/Linux/Mac.
If you have an old Bomber (xxx.hpc.sbg.ac.at), the MEG raw data storage is mounted on /mnt/sinuhe. The mount is read-only so you cannot write or modify data there.

Information regarding the participants as well as MR data can be access in the subject database.
